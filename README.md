# AI Video Editor - Smart Social Media Content Platform

Local desktop & mobile app using AI to transform long videos into optimized short clips for social media platforms.

## Tech Stack
- Flutter (frontend)
- Python FastAPI (backend)
- FFmpeg (media processing)

## Backend (FastAPI)

The backend service powers project configuration, clip management, and media processing orchestration. It is built with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and Alembic and ships with a modular application layout under `backend/app`.

### Getting Started
1. Create and activate a Python 3.11 virtual environment.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
   ```
3. Copy the environment file and adjust values as needed:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn backend.app.main:app --reload
   ```

A health check endpoint is exposed at `GET /health/`.

### Database & Migrations

SQLite is used by default for local development (configured in `.env`).

- Run migrations to initialise or update the schema:
  ```bash
  alembic -c backend/alembic.ini upgrade head
  ```
- Create a new migration (autogenerated from your models):
  ```bash
  alembic -c backend/alembic.ini revision --autogenerate -m "describe changes"
  ```

### Logging

Structured logging is configured out of the box. Set `LOG_FORMAT=json` in your `.env` file to switch from the default human-readable console formatter to JSON logs suitable for log aggregation systems.
